A warm husky voice, hooky melodies, folksy guitar riffs, Mileva has a way of catching your ear and touching your soul. Her honest and heartfelt songwriting skills led her to win 2 ‘best original song’ awards in the Open Mic UK 2017 competition.

She moved from her home city of Paris to London in 2013 and self released her debut EP, 'Free'. It captures the magic of coming of age through travels, experiences and freedom of spirit.

Shortly after that, she joined the reggae collective DOJO, signed on BBE record label, and toured with the band as their frontwoman for 5 years.

Mileva is currently working on a new EP and other exciting recording projects that will be released later in the year... Until then you can hear her perform every week in London! Go to the gig page for news about her next shows.
